_UltraStar Play_ is a free and open source "sing-along" karaoke game for desktop and mobile. More platforms (e.g. Xbox, PlayStation) might be added in the future.

The game plays an audio file, displays lyrics, notes, and optionally a background video or image. Up to six players sing along and try to hit notes to earn points.

Checkout the [wiki](https://github.com/UltraStar-Deluxe/Play/wiki/First-Steps) to get started.

### Songs
By default, the game is packed with only a few [Creative Commons licensed demo songs](https://github.com/UltraStar-Deluxe/songs).

However, the game can play any song in the widely used UltraStar format and there are thousands of these songs online.
Please use your favorite web search engine to find additional song packages (free or paid-for, depending on licensing).

Furthermore, _UltraStar Play_ has an integrated [song editor](https://github.com/UltraStar-Deluxe/Play/wiki/Song-Editor) to help you create the songs you always wanted. <br />
