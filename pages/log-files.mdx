# Log Files
Log files are text files that help developers understand and debug issues.

When you open a bug report, it is always a good idea to attach a log file so developers can better determine what went wrong.

### Copy Log
You can view and copy the log directly in the game using the corresponding buttons in the development options.

export default ({ children }) => (
    <MdxLayoutComponent>{children}</MdxLayoutComponent>
);
