# Search Expressions
You can use C# expressions to search for songs in your local song library.

Note however that this only works for selected song properties.

Example:
- `Genre == "Rock"`
    - Finds songs where the `Genre` property is set to Rock
- `1990 <= Year && Year <= 1999`
    - Finds songs where the `Year` property is between 1990 and 1999
- `Video != null && Video.Length > 0`
    - Finds songs where the `Video` property is set to a non-empty value
- `Title.ToLower().Contains("summer")`
    - Finds songs where the `Title` property contains the text "summer", independent of upper and lower case

## Syntax
Syntax rules of C# apply.

For example
- Uppercase / lowercase is relevant: 
    - Use `Title.Contains("something")`, not  `title.contains("something")`
- Comparisons use `==` (equals), `!=` (not equals), `<` (less than), `>` (greater than), `<=` (less or equal), `>=` (greater or equal)
    - Note the double equals sign. A single equals sign would be an assignment and will not work in the search.
- AND is written as `&&`, OR is written as `||`
- strings must be quoted
- Parentheses can be used to order the evaluation

export default ({ children }) => (
    <MdxLayoutComponent>{children}</MdxLayoutComponent>
);
