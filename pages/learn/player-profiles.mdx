# Player Profiles
- Configure player profiles to quickly switch between players during the game.
- You can disable player profiles in the settings. Only enabled player profiles are available during song select.

## Custom Player Profile Images
- You can add custom player profile images (PNG or JPG files).
    - TIP: Browse player profile images and other user-generated content on [Steam Workshop](/learn/steam-workshop).
- You can add a profile image using a webcam or integrated camera of your device.
    - Therefor, select the the very last profile image in the list and take a snapshot.
- Player profile images are searched in specific folders:
    - `<mod-folder>/PlayerProfileImages`
    - `<data-folder>/PlayerProfileImages`
    - `<installation-path>/UltraStar Play_Data/StreamingAssets/PlayerProfileImages`
- To install a player profile image, copy it to one of these locations. A restart of the game may be required afterwards.
