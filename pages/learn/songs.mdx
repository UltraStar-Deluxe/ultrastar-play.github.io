# Song Format
UltraStar Play supports songs in UltraStar format.

- An UltraStar song consists of
    - An audio file
    - A plain text file (txt) with information about the song (audio file, artist, title, lyrics, notes, etc.)
    - Optionally, image and video files for album art or backgrounds
    - TIP: If your background video has an audio track then it can be used for both, audio file and background video.

# How to Add Songs
### Download Song Archive
- UltraStar Play can download and unpack ZIP and TAR archives with songs directly in-game.
    - TIP: There is an UltraStar [song package](https://github.com/UltraStar-Deluxe/songs) with Creative Commons licensed songs that can be added to your library this way
- To download an archive
    - navigate to the song library settings
    - click the button to download songs
    - add the song archive URL
    - start the download
    - NOTE: This will automatically add a new song folder to your local library.

### Add Existing Songs
- If you already have all files of an UltraStar song, you can
    - add a song folder entry in the settings that points to your local song files
        - NOTE: Android requires songs to be stored in special folders for security reasons. The required folder path is device specific and can be found in the song library settings.
    - or store your song under an song folder path

### Create Custom Songs
- You can use the the integrated [song editor](/learn/song-editor) of UltraStar Play to create UltraStar songs of your local song library.

# Loading Songs
You can choose whether to load songs
- Upfront: Scans all song folders for UltraStar txt files and loads their content.
    - This requires more time initially, but afterwards it is smoother during song select.
- On-demand: Scans all song folders for UltraStar txt files but does not load their content.
    - This requires less time initially, but may take some time to load the txt file when the song is shown during song select.

- Video files: avi, f4v, flv, mkv, mov, mp4, mpg, webm (webm with VP8 recommended), wmv
