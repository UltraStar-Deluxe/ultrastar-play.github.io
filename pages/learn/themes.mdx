# What is a Theme
- A theme can be used to change the appearance and several sound effects of the game.
    - TIP: Browse themes and other user-generated content on [Steam Workshop](/learn/steam-workshop).
- A theme is defined in a JSON file called the *theme file*.

## How to Install Themes
- Themes files are searched in specific folders:
    - `<mod-folder>/Themes`
    - `<data-folder>/Themes`
    - `<installation-path>/UltraStar Play_Data/StreamingAssets/Themes`
- To install a theme, copy it to one of these locations. A restart of the game may be required afterwards.

# How to Develop Themes
- Theme development for UltraStar Play means editing a JSON file to adjust properties.
- There is a commented example theme file that explains all available fields.
- Note that a theme can reference one or more style sheets, which use a Unity specific variation of CSS. These can be used to change the style of most of the UI.

export default ({ children }) => (
    <MdxLayoutComponent>{children}</MdxLayoutComponent>
);
