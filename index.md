## UltraStar Play - free&libre sing-along karaoke game

_UltraStar Play_ is a free and open source "sing-along" karaoke game for Windows, Linux, Android, iOS, Xbox, PlayStation and other modern platforms. The game plays the audio file, displays singing lyrics, notes and optionally a background video or picture, while the singers sing the songs and thus try to hit the notes to get points, depending on how close they get to the perfect pitches. The game uses the Unity 2D framework and mostly c# (mono/.Net) as software development language.

By default, the games is packed with only a few [creative commons licensed demo songs](https://github.com/UltraStar-Deluxe/songs), but it can easily be extended with third party song packages using the ultrastar song fomat. To find additional song packages (free or paid for depending on licensing), please use your favorite web search engine.
