## UltraStar Play - free & libre sing-along karaoke game

_UltraStar Play_ is a free and open-source "sing-along" karaoke game for Windows, Linux, Android, iOS, Xbox, PlayStation and other modern platforms. The game plays the audio file, displays lyrics, notes, and optionally a background video or picture. The players sing the songs and try to hit the notes to get points.

By default, the game is packed with only a few [Creative Commons licensed demo songs](https://github.com/UltraStar-Deluxe/songs). 
However, the _UltraStar Play_ has an integrated [song editor](https://github.com/UltraStar-Deluxe/Play/wiki/Song-Editor) to help you create the karaoke songs you always wanted. <br />
Furthermore, the game can easily be extended with third party songs using the UltraStar song fomat. Please use your favorite web search engine to find additional song packages (free or paid-for, depending on licensing).
